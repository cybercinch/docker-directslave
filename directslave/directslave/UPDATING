VERSION 3.3
============
+ Fixed XSS vulnerability on login screen
+ Fixed check errors when rndc is disabled
-> Minor bugs fixed

VERSION 3.2
============
Renamed to Advanced.

+ Now we have nice & smooth web-interface to control over our secondary zones (add, remove & change master IP)
+ Ability to manage users through web
+ Viewing DirectSlave log files
+ Master-file format setting (requested by SeLLeRoNe :: See forum post http://forum.directadmin.com/showthread.php?t=54992&page=2&p=287125#post287125)

VERSION 3.0.2-beta 
============
+ RNDC queue. Due to DirectAdmin behavior, when it sends multiple "add" requests for newly added domain, 
  every single request forces DirectSlave to trigger `rndc`, which causes CPU load due to `named` config reload.
  Now, if domain added/removed/reloaded on primary, internal rndc queue populated with events and processed 
  once per 30 seconds, `rndc reload` called only if events exists in queue.
  You can watch `rndc` events entries in action.log like this: 
  2017/06/27 13:09:21 RNDC queue triggered with 2 events
  2017/06/27 13:09:21 RNDC output: reloaded

============
-> Minor bugs fixed
- extra output supressed

VERSION 3.0-beta:
============
-> DirectSlave core completely rewriten from perl to Golang, now it is statically compiled for many systems
   including FreeBSD i386/amd64 & Linux i386/amd64/arm.
-> No dependencies. You can run it on fresh system install, so you secondary DNS will up and running
   in a couple of minutes.
-> All configuration options (except for `allow`, `uid` and `gid`) remains the same.
- removed `allow` option from config file, please use your local firewall.
- removed username and groupname in config fields: `uid` and `gid`. Now using system ID of user and group required.
- removed `server_type` option from config file, it's always HTTP.
- removed "pass" tool. To manipulate passwd file, run directslave with --password or --delete flags.
- removed /lib folder. Dont' need it anymore.
+ added --status flag to check directslave is running or not.
+ some debug added [full URL & Query map printed in error.log]
+ added handling of /CMD_EMAIL_POP via scripts in /scripts folder.
+ added /scripts folder. See comments in scripts itself.
+ added /CMD_API_MEMORY_MONITOR for memory usage monitoring, outputs UrlEncoded string with current values
! there is no config reload on -HUP signal handler, -HUP is handled just for compatibility with 'newsyslog'
  You can see in error.log something like "RELOAD: Signal hangup received, reloading" 
  but actually it just reopen the log files, not reloading itself and|or config file.

- 'auth' option removed
+ 'authfile' option added.
+ etc/passwd file added.
+ ssl options and directory added.

============
-> Minor error fixes. No need to update, if your current setup work well.
- binary contains some fixes about 'line 109 bug' (see this thread 
  http://forum.directadmin.com/showthread.php?t=43924)
- lib/CGI.pm replaced with lib/DSGI.pm to prevent binary from use default 
  (unpatched) version of CGI perl module from some linux distros
- added etc/rc.d folder, which contains startup/shutdown scripts for 
  various systems (now for *BSD only, sorry)
- etc/directslave.conf unchanged
